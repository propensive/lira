// The invocation point, alone in its own build module. `externalize` (from burdock, re-exported
// through `soundness.*`) records the SHA-256 of every jar on THIS module's compile classpath into
// `META-INF/burdock.deps` at compile time; because the `launcher` module depends on `fury-core`
// as a PUBLISHED coordinate (see build.mill), the released jar bytes on the classpath match the
// published ones, and `soundness.repackage` externalizes them into an on-demand download rather
// than inlining. The whole command dispatch lives in `fury.run` in the published `core` module.
